Assignment 2: Building a Support Agent Chatbot for CDP
"How-to" Questions
Objective:
Develop a chatbot that can answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data
Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot should be able
to extract relevant information from the official documentation of these CDPs to guide
users on how to perform tasks or achieve specific outcomes within each platform.
Data Sources:
● Segment Documentation: https://segment.com/docs/?ref=nav
● mParticle Documentation: https://docs.mparticle.com/
● Lytics Documentation: https://docs.lytics.com/
● Zeotap Documentation: https://docs.zeotap.com/home/en-us/
Core Functionalities:
1. Answer "How-to" Questions:
○ The chatbot should be able to understand and respond to user questions
about how to perform specific tasks or use features within each CDP.
○ Example questions:
■ "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
■ "How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
■ "How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
■ "How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"
2. Extract Information from Documentation:
○ The chatbot should be capable of retrieving relevant information from the
provided documentation to answer user questions.
○ It should be able to navigate through the documentation, identify relevant
sections, and extract the necessary instructions or steps.
3. Handle Variations in Questions:
○ Size variations. E.g extremely long question should not break it down.
○ Questions irrelevant to CDP. e.g Which Movie is getting released this
week.
Bonus Features:
● Cross-CDP Comparisons:
○ The chatbot can answer questions about the differences in approaches or
functionalities between the four CDPs.
○ Example question: "How does Segment's audience creation process
compare to Lytics'?"
● Advanced "How-to" Questions:
○ The chatbot can handle more complex or platform-specific "how-to"
questions.
○ It can provide guidance on advanced configurations, integrations, or use
cases.
Evaluation Criteria:
● Accuracy and completeness of assignment.
● Code quality and build.
● Handling of variations in question phrasing and terminology.
● Implementation of bonus features (cross-CDP comparisons, advanced
questions).
● Overall user experience and chatbot interaction.
Additional Notes:
● You can use any natural language processing (NLP) libraries or frameworks to
build the chatbot. Instead of NLP you can also use simple document indexer.
● You can choose to implement the chatbot as a web application using any tool.
● The focus of this assignment is software engineering and not Model building
